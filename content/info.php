			<h2>Why Concrete?</h2>
			<p>
				One of the primary benefits when choosing concrete over granite or engineered quartz is that every finished product has an appearance that is truly one of a kind. Granite is not only more expensive, but it is done in a cookie cutter fashion. This leaves the designs looking very much alike, and in today's interior design world they are quickly outdated and cliche. Finished concrete, however, is always beautiful and completely unique in its appearance. The look you choose will be absolutely exclusive to your home.
